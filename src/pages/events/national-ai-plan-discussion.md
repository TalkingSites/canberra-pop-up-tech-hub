The government just dropped its [National AI Plan](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/national-ai-plan) this week (December 2nd). Want to chat about what it actually means?

We're talking about $30 million for a new AI Safety Institute, pushing data centers to run on renewables, and the big question: will this create good jobs or just cut them?

No PowerPoints, no jargon, just a conversation about how AI might change work, what protections workers actually get, and whether Australia's playing catch-up or getting ahead.

Bring your questions, skepticism, or just curiosity.
