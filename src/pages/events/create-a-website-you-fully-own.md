title: Create a Website You Fully Own
description: In this workshop, you will learn how to create your own website
  from scratch and leave with a live, fully functional site. You will gain
  hands-on experience with how your site is built, where it is hosted, and how
  to update it on your own. This approach gives you full control over your
  website without relying on third-party platforms, making it suitable for
  artists, community groups, and small businesses. By the end, you will have a
  clear understanding of your site’s structure and the ability to manage it
  independently.
