Join us at Skill Studio for a special session the night before Bitcoin Whitepaper Day, as we explore what it really means to run a Bitcoin node — the beating heart of the Bitcoin network.

This session is non-technical and beginner-friendly, designed for anyone curious about how Bitcoin works, why decentralisation matters, and what it takes to run your own node at home.

Our speaker, Crypto Marxist — one of Canberra Blockchain’s community members and a long-time node operator — will share real-world insights from running a Bitcoin node: what worked, what didn’t, and why it’s one of the most empowering things you can do in Bitcoin.

### We’ll cover:

- What Bitcoin is and how it really works   
- Why you should (or shouldn’t) run your own node   
- Hardware and software setup options (Raspberry Pi, desktop, VPS, etc.)   
- The Bitcoin Core vs Knots debate   
- How nodes uphold privacy, sovereignty, and trustless verification

To celebrate Bitcoin’s origins, we’ll also run a Free Bitcoin Raffle for attendees who register and come along.
