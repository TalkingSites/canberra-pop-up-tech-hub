You will gain hands-on experience with how your site is built, where it is hosted, and how to update it on your own. This approach gives you full control over your website without relying on third-party platforms, making it suitable for artists, community groups, and small businesses. By the end, you will have a clear understanding of your site’s structure and the ability to manage it independently.
